This is the HTML/CSS unit project from the Odin project. It contains two modes, easy and hard.
Easy mode entails visually recreating the simple Google homepage our of HTML code using simple inline CSS for formatting. None of the links have to work but all the text and graphics must be in the generally correct place. Links were made to work somewhat for the sake of challenge.

Hard mode is to create the result page for a given search. This form is a lot more involved in its formatting and requires the use of attached CSS documents to be properly displayed.
